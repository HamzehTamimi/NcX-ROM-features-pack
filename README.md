# NcX-ROM-features-pack

**This is a Magisk module that adds so many new features for the NcX ROM (S21 FE port)!**

This module is made for device supported by NcX ROM:
 - A52 4G
 - A52s 5G
 - M52 5G
 - A71

Features included in the module:
- Bixby Touch (CHC firmware feature)
- Fresh ROM features (full credit for the amazing devs of the ROM)
- Daily Board (Galaxy Tab features)
- Fully working Air Command (use this app to launch it: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RZEGbGFZmRkgCfsd5t6TaGXbmE8_wnl6/view?usp=share_link)
- Z Fold series taskbar
- Content suggestion service (Secure Folder feature from INS firmware)
- Some camera feature (more to come)
- Samsung My Files shortcut in settings

There are also many small features added that I don't remember too (may add them in the feature list later)... 

*I own the A52 4G, so I will do tests on it, and you can test and give feedback for other devices (and of A52 4G course), on the XDA thread (when I set it up), the focus will be on A52 4G but the experience should be same on all devices and all will get updates on the same time expect if there is a device specific fix update.*

    Please use this only on NcX ROM for your device
